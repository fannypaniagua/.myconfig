; Example of custom screen position definition:
;
; [name-of-screen-position]
; direction     - direction of move, expand, shrink
; position      - position relative to screen (for put and grid)
; gravity       - window gravity (if no gravity set, same as position)
; widths        - list of widths for grid
; heights       - list of height for grid
; 
; valid direction, position, gravity values:
; - TOP_LEFT, TOP, TOP_RIGHT, 
; - LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT, 
; - BOTTOM_LEFT, BOTTOM, BOTTOM_RIGHT
; - or x, y percent value - eg: 1.0, 0.5
;
; valid widths, heights values:
; - QUARTER, THIRD, HALF, FULL
; - 1.0/3*2 or THIRD*2 (will be evaluated)
